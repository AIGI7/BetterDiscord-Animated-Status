Did you read README.md?

I can't help you, if you don't provide a clear explanation of the problem you're facing.
A good example would be:
I am using the newest Discord version and installed the newest version of the plugin.
When opening the settings page and setting a custom status, clicking the save button
does not apply the status. There is no error message. Closing and reopening the settings page shows the changes. Restarting discord fixes the problem temporarily.

When opening a new issue, please _respond_ after there was an effort to help you.
